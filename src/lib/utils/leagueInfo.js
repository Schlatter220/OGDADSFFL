  <p>Welcome to the OG Dads FFL website presented by candidate Cory aka Zyn N Whiskey. This is a tool providing everything we could ever want and more. Manager bios, league blogs, rankings, and a trophy room. Some might say what’s the point? Most of this is on sleeper? Well because this is cool as fuck that’s why. Just another tool at our disposal to use and mess around with to create the ultimate fantasy experience keeping this group of gorillas together. </p>
<p> As we transition into a new era of OG Dads FFL, we do not wish to erase the past or to slander those that came before us. All eras will be remembered honorably. However this is a new age, stakes have never been higher, grudge matches have never meant more, and it’s time we go legit. </p>
